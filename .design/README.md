## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Hey folks! So you're a designer, and you're willing to collaborate. This is the right place!

Let's keep it short: `jql` is a CLI tool currently available on different platforms / package managers. 

You can see a usage example over here (or try to install and use it on your own ðŸ˜Š):

## ðŸš¢ How to contribute

1. Check out open [issues](https://github.com/yamafaktory/jql/issues) here on GitHub (we label them with `design: ðŸ’…required`)
2. Feel free to open an issue on your own if you find something you would like to contribute to the project and use the `design: ðŸ’¡idea` label for it.
3. We do not have any design files in place yet so feel free to create new ones and share them publicly
4. Add your contributions to an issue and we promise we will review your contribution carefully and foster discussions


Other then that â€“ there's no specific constraint - sky is the limit. 


## ðŸŽ­ Target audience

Since this is a command line interface â€“ our target audience are purely users of command line interfaces


 ## ðŸ’… Design relevant materials

 As mentioned above â€“ we do not have any design related materials (Logo, Figma mocks, etc) yet. Feel free to add them to this document as things evolve.
