## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Hey folks! So you're a designer, and you're willing to collaborate. This is the right place!

## ðŸš¢ How to contribute

Let's keep it short: `jql` is a CLI tool currently available on different platforms / package managers, but the project has no logo.

If you're interested, there's no specific constraint - sky is the limit. Feel free to open an issue if you would like to contribute to the project and use the `design: ðŸ’¡idea` label for it.
